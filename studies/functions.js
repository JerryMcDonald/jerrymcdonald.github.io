                 /*/ Functions */

    //  When we want to design a task that can be called upon (invoked) by our code
    //   we make functions. Functions are blocks of code that sit dormant until we
    //   need to use it. Here is an example of proper function syntex.
     // by typing function then typing a function name we are declairing 
     // a function.
     // The p1 in the code below is the parameter, it is like getting a new
     // variable that we can pass a value into when we 'invoke' the function.
     function firstFunction (p1) {
         // Function code block
     }







/* 1. What are the two phases to using functions?




2. Difference between parameters and the arguments passed to a function
Requirements:

1. The two phases to using functions: First we must ___? Next we can execute (or two other words for executing a function?) a function by?

2. What’s the difference between a function’s parameters and arguments PASSED to a function?

3. What’s the syntax for a NAMED function?
4. How do we assign a function to a variable?

5. Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs, and OPTIONALLY return a single value. How do we specify inputs, and how do we specify outputs?

6. Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. The inverse is NOT true.

7. Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. If an object returned from the Function and is held in memory somewhere (referenced), 
that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist in these closures! (See: our meeting-room app for an example!) (ALSO, see: Understanding JavaScript
Closures with Ease)
