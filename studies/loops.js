Say you would like to loop for a given number of times, you can use a for or a while loop
for this. This can give you the building blocks for great code. Lets say you would like
to console.log every number between 1 and 5. The uneffecent way to do this (also known as 
hard coding) is to type your code like this.

/*
A much eaiser way is to use a for loop


If you would like to use a for loop. You need to first declare a staring variable. Then

}
